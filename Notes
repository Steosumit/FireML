1. url: AnyHttpUrl = Field(..., alias='check_url', description='URL to evaluate')

Defines a field named url in the model.
AnyHttpUrl is a Pydantic type — it ensures the value is a valid HTTP/HTTPS URL.
Field(...) means:
... → this field is required (must be provided).
alias='check_url' → when receiving JSON input, the key will be check_url, not url.

2. Use of _model_lock
_model_lock = Lock() object does this
- locks a instance block run to avoid another run to execute it
- if a block is in locked state it waits for its release

3. Converting types to a single model type using validator.py:
The input payload can come in three forms : PredictRequestModel, str, Mapping(dictionary)
To process all to a single PredictRequestModel type, we use a validator using isinstance function
    def _coerce_request(payload: Union[PredictRequestModel, str, Mapping]) -> PredictRequestModel:
        if isinstance(payload, PredictRequestModel):
            return payload
        if isinstance(payload, str):
            return PredictRequestModel(check_url=payload)
        if isinstance(payload, Mapping):
            return PredictRequestModel(**payload)
        raise RequestValidationError("Unsupported payload type for validation")
